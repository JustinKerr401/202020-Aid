    <h1 style="font-size: 5rem;">20/20/20 Rule: Vision Aid</h1>
    <img src="logo.png" style="width: 400px;">
    <p>Migranes stink. Screens stink. Additionally, it stinks to have to pay money just to be
        able to reliably automate the process of maintaining the 20/20/20 rule. I don't like
        having to purchase a subscription so that I can live my day-to-day as healthy as possible.<br><br>
        To solve this dilema, I designed a PWA that acts as a simple app for tracking my screen use 
        and encouraging me to follow the 20/20/20 rule:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>20 minutes of screen use, then</li>
        <li>20 seconds looking at something</li>
        <li>20 feet away or more</li>
    </ul>
    <button id="activator" onclick="shift()">Start</button>
    <h3 id="time">00:00</h3>
