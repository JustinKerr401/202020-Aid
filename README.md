# Purpose
Frequent screen use can contribute to migraines, and maintaining the 20/20/20 rule can be challenging—especially when reliable automation tools require a paid subscription. To address this issue, I developed a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides a simple, accessible way to track screen time and support adherence to the 20/20/20 rule.
- 20 minutes of screen use, then
- 20 seconds looking at something
- 20 feet away or more
