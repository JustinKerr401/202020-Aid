# Purpose
Frequent screen use can contribute to migraines, and maintaining the 20/20/20 rule can be challenging—especially when reliable automation tools require a paid subscription. To address this issue, I developed a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides a simple, accessible way to track screen time and support adherence to the 20/20/20 rule.
- 20 minutes of screen use, then
- 20 seconds looking at something
- 20 feet away or more

# Limitations
This project is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) rather than a native application. As a result, it has limited access to system-level background processes. The app cannot reliably run in the background, which restricts its effectiveness on mobile devices—particularly on iOS, where background execution is tightly controlled.

Because of this limitation, the experience on phones is less consistent than on traditional desktop or laptop environments. However, the app performs well on computers, where it can remain active during work sessions. This still makes it useful for its primary purpose: supporting healthy screen habits while working at a desk.
